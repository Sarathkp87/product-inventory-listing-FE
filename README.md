# React Frontend

This React app provides a simple interface to manage products and categories. It communicates with the Express API server via REST endpoints and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build for production

Before running, install dependencies with `npm install`. Make sure the backend API is running on `https://product-inventory-listing-be.onrender.com` or update the API URLs accordingly. Categories can be managed from `/categories` in the app.
